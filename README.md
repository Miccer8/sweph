## Known Issues and Caveats

* Due to how the underlying C library operates, you may find that the `error` field returned by some functions will contain data even if there is no actual error. This can happen when existing memory buffers are recycled and the user must handle it by also checking the returned flag values as per the Swiss Ephemeris documentation.
* While worker_threads are supported, the underlying C library is single threaded and its settings are global. Functions such as `set_ephe_path()` will affect the entire process, including worker_threads. While you can still use worker_threads as long as you dont change settings from other threads in the middle of calculations, true thead-safe multithreading can be achieved using child_process instead.
